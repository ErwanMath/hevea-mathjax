# hevea-mathjax

This source is a short-term fork from Inria's Hevea software,
whose current maintainer is Luc Maranget (see the README file
for contact details and the LICENCE file for the licence).

For the moment, the only change is the addition of a 
-mathjax option that leaves math unchanged, and thus processable
by MathJax on the output file. It is planned to add a -reveals
option to provide a translation of beamer .pdf presentations into
reveals.js .html presentations.
